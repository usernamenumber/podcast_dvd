<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Recap!</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We open on a group of young people talking to their mentor &#8211; but not, for once, on our main cast.<span>&#160; </span>This group is clearly planning something &#8211; and their plans take a turn for the ominous when one of their number spots Arkahn and the others arguing in the entryway of an inn.<span>&#160; </span>Mike wants to continue westward, but everyone else thinks he&#8217;s being ridiculous; the party eventually decides to turn around after a night&#8217;s rest, and Arkahn and Katherine go to settle in.<span>&#160; </span>As they reach their room, however, someone knocks them both out and drags them off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mike and Jareth continue their argument in their own room, and it slowly escalates until Jareth tells Mike that he regrets saving his life last year.<span>&#160; </span>Before the fight can continue, however, Zana bursts in to tell them that the girls are missing.<span>&#160; </span>When they continue their arguments, Zana finally loses it and goes to take care of business herself.<span>&#160; </span>She enlists the aid of the innkeep&#8217;s employees in helping the boys to search.<span>&#160; </span>Zana stays behind, but not before sending Fesmer off on his own mission.<span>&#160; </span>It turns out Garvin the inkeeper is the head of a fake band of Hunters of Truth, and they&#8217;re working to destroy a local tae-oden processing factory in order to help the locals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Katherine and Arkahn awaken in a strange room, blindfolded and bound, and realize why they&#8217;ve been taken: the woman who spotted them is Cheanti, the woman from Laundi who Arkahn tortured the prior year for information about the Red Circle.<span>&#160; </span>Cheanti has had a year to dwell on the loss of her husband and unborn child, and proceeds to extract her revenge; she beats Arkahn into unconsciousness, then when Katherine begs for forgiveness, smashes both her hands.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mike and Jareth, after being manipulated by Garvin&#8217;s prot&#233;g&#233;s, break into the false tae-oden disposal facility, where they are quickly discovered by Legionnaires.<span>&#160; </span>Katherine and Arkahn run to help, as they&#8217;ve been forced by Cheanti to plant bomb charges in the factory.<span>&#160; </span>After a close call with Mike falling in a tae-oden vat, the fight is ended by the arrival of Fesmer, Garvin, and Zana, who announces that, as a founder of the Hunters of Truth, she is putting this farce to an end.<span>&#160; </span>Unfortunately, the bomb has already been set to detonate, and when Garvin&#8217;s group blow up the controls, it&#8217;s all our gang can do to survive an explosion that levels the building.<span>&#160; </span>When the flames die down, all we can hear is Mike desperately searching for anyone else who&#8217;s still alive.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I want you guys to know, before I even get started, that just loading up this episode still kinda makes my stomach knot up with preemptive anxiety.<span>&#160; </span>And that, my friends, is what good writing can do to you.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- It&#8217;s really disorienting to see&#8230;err, <em>hear</em> a group of young people bickering amongst themselves about a grand plan they have, only to be settled down by their mentor&#8230;and not have any emotional attachment to ANY of them.<span>&#160; </span>I was actually just talking to a friend who&#8217;s started listening to 2S about this, and she had an interesting perspective; she&#8217;s not quite halfway through Season 1, and she mentioned to me that &#8220;I just kinda want to smack all of them!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>And y&#8217;know, she&#8217;s kind of right; in the beginning, Shauna <em>is</em> whiny, Katherine <em>can</em> be a bitch, and Mike acts like an <strong>idiot</strong>.<span>&#160; </span>Unlike me, she hasn&#8217;t gotten attached to them enough to forgive them their faults yet &#8211; which is exactly what we the audience experience when we hear Garvin and his prot&#233;g&#233;s.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;What&#8217;s with you lately, always questioning my-&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>And here we have another hint that Arkahn&#8217;s patience with Mike is wearing thin.<span>&#160; </span>Can&#8217;t really blame her, either; in Boston she was utterly dependent on him, and now back in Baela, where she&#8217;s finally able to take care of herself again, he&#8217;s taken the lead.<span>&#160; </span>She hasn&#8217;t gotten a break from him in over a year!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;We should have gone to visit Velia at that fork last week.&#8221; Yeah, Fesmer, because you have NO ULTIRIOR MOTIVES to get the group to go to Velia.<span>&#160; </span>NONE AT ALL.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I know Fesmer cuts her off, but seriously, Zana didn&#8217;t think to mention Sonsa before this point?<span>&#160; </span>I wonder why?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Up is down, the sky is orange, and Katherine just told Mike to stop being so uptight.<span>&#160; </span><em>My world no longer makes sense</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Back when I was first listening to this, I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what to make of Zana&#8217;s nightmares; after all, they&#8217;re only given this one brief mention, and quite frankly by the end of this episode we&#8217;ve got bigger things to worry about.<span>&#160; </span>Still, given our characters&#8217; history with dreams, I should have known to take Zana&#8217;s nightmares more seriously.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Jareth and Mike are, admittedly, being really immature here&#8230;but having been on more than a few road trips, I have to admit to being impressed that they&#8217;ve made it this long without coming to blows.<span>&#160; </span>Being around someone for that long, particularly someone you rarely see eye-to-eye with, while under a lot of pressure isn&#8217;t easy, and makes outbursts like this almost inevitable.<span>&#160; </span>That being said, <em>damn</em>, I think I&#8217;m getting lightheaded from all the testosterone here.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;You asked me once why I did not let you die; trust me, I ask myself that!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Aaaand this is the point where Jareth officially goes too far.<span>&#160; </span>He must really be doubtful of his own abilities as a leader of others if Mike&#8217;s jibes pushed him to this point.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- ANGRY ZANA &#9829;&#9829;&#9829;.<span>&#160; </span>Really though, at this point I love Zana almost more than I can articulate.<span>&#160; </span>This is a woman who spent several years leading a huge organization consisting of people from all different backgrounds, and she is finally done sitting on the sidelines.<span>&#160; </span>If no one else is going to get this ragtag bunch whipped into shape, SHE WILL.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- And look at how quickly she sees right through Garvin!<span>&#160; </span>She&#8217;s only talked to him for, what, 3 minutes?<span>&#160; </span>And already she can tell he was probably involved in the disappearance.<span>&#160; </span><s>I just have so many FEELINGS about Zana, and for this I refuse to apologize</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;&#8230;why does the spaceship run on ravioli?&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Why hello there, last bit of humor of the episode, I will wave to you as you go by, leaving only tension and my stomach tying itself into knots.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- We get a hint here of just how good Katherine&#8217;s memory is (which will, of course, be important later on) in how quickly she&#8217;s able to place Cheanti.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;She&#8217;s left the Legion and now seeks to repent for her actions!&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;How nice for her.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>There&#8217;s an interesting lesson to be learned here I think: redemption and forgiveness are two very different things.<span>&#160; </span>When you&#8217;ve done something wrong and you seek to atone, you can&#8217;t rely on someone else&#8217;s forgiveness to assuage your crimes, because a victim is never obligated to forgive.<span>&#160; </span>It can be part of the healing process, yes, but it&#8217;s not necessary&#8230;and when you&#8217;ve suffered as much as Cheanti clearly has, forgiveness may not be something you want or are ready to grant.<span>&#160; </span>Redemption must be sought after for its own sake, even if the people you hurt don&#8217;t forgive you.<span>&#160; </span>Even if no one else quite grasps this, I really think Arkahn does; a few episodes ago, she freely admitted that she doesn&#8217;t want anyone&#8217;s forgiveness; it&#8217;s her <em>own</em> guilt that she seeks to own up to, and no one else&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;You are just as guilty&#8230;perhaps more so.&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;I am.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>It is very clear, from the way Katherine says this, that this is EXACTLY what she has been thinking for the past year and a half.<span>&#160; </span>As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, Katherine is the type of person who&#8217;s her own worst critic; every flaw, every mistake, every misjudgment gets turned around and around in her head (whether this is conscious or not, I&#8217;m still not sure).<span>&#160; </span>She&#8217;s intensely sensitive to all but the most gentle criticism, because there&#8217;s not a single word of it that she hasn&#8217;t already thought herself.<span>&#160; </span>So when she makes a mistake as massive as the one she made in <em>Trust Me</em>, and is allowed to dwell on it for as long as she did, it should surprise no one when she makes such a drastic decision in order to repent of it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- For all that I talked about how very unsettling the execution scene in <em>Innocence Lost</em> is&#8230;this might be even worse.<span>&#160; </span>Correnlai&#8217;s execution is effective because it&#8217;s intensely violent and sudden.<span>&#160; </span>The breaking of Katherine&#8217;s hands is similarly violent, similarly sudden&#8230;but it&#8217;s happening to someone we <em>know</em>.<span>&#160; </span>And unlike the execution, where the audience is &#8220;watching&#8221; from Shauna&#8217;s viewpoint, at this moment in the scene, Katherine <em>is</em> our viewpoint.<span>&#160; </span>There&#8217;s this intense feeling of helplessness as we hear her go through this, and complete shock when, after having the first hand broken, she freely offers up the other.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s gorgeously written, brilliantly acted, and deeply, deeply horrifying.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Alright, I&#8217;m pretty much just gushing my way through the entire cast, I know, but Lily <strong><em>makes</em></strong> this scene.<span>&#160; </span>The way she conveys Katherine&#8217;s soul-wrenching guilt is amazing, and my god, I&#8217;ve never been quite so disturbed by someone screaming.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Some places do not thrive.<span>&#160; </span>Some places are designated as acceptable sacrifices to the greater good.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Lest we become too comfortable with the &#8220;truths&#8221; Porec and Shauna were discussing a few episodes ago, a reminder: yes, sometimes we have to make sacrifices for the greater good&#8230;but that still means that someone, somewhere, <em>will suffer</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Hmm&#8230;I&#8217;d think this town would be reminiscent of Detroit more than Philly, but that may be because I have a friend from there who once described the city and its residents in almost exactly the same way that Mike and Jareth describe the townsfolk.<span>&#160; </span>It was a little unnerving.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Now Oren, the Forsaken One, his spite was so strong that he willed himself to live until the revenge upon the other Seven had been fulfilled.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Given what we find out down the road about Oren and his peculiar longevity, this isn&#8217;t entirely accurate &#8211; but it is interesting to see which aspects of the truth wound up in Baelan mythology.<span>&#160; </span><s>Also, yeah, how&#8217;s that whole immortality thing working out for you, Oren?</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;At this time, the University Directive was still a great force in the world&#8230;&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Now I&#8217;m curious: what exactly does this mean?<span>&#160; </span>The whole period of Oren&#8217;s splitting off from the Seven and the founding of the Universities is hazy, even with the information we get later on. <span>&#160;</span>So was the University Directive the name given to the period where the Seven founded the schools?<span>&#160; </span>Or is it the name for something more specific?<span>&#160; </span>(<strong>SPOILERS</strong>) (By the by, I really appreciate the fact that we don&#8217;t ever get the full story; it happened 900 years ago, and the only one who was there was Oren, who is in <strong>no way</strong> capable of telling an impartial version of the story.<span>&#160; </span>That&#8217;s how history works, after all &#8211; the people who come after make educated guesses, but everyone&#8217;s version of things is altered by their own biases, and in the end, <em>you weren&#8217;t there</em>.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Okay, if I go off on the Father Fox story, we&#8217;re gonna be here all day, so here&#8217;re some highlights: 1. This strikes me as a story that originated with the Legion, not University, so it must be very old indeed if it&#8217;s worked its way into common folklore enough that Jareth, born in University territory, heard it as a child.<span>&#160; </span>2. Looking back, this was a clear metaphor for Oren&#8217;s development of ritual magic and how the Seven &#8220;stole&#8221; it.<span>&#160; </span>Ah, the wonders of retrospect.<span>&#160; </span>3. &#8220;You must explore where they do not.&#8221; Potential Legion exploration of &#8220;forbidden&#8221; technology?<span>&#160; </span>4. Mother Woodpecker and Brother Rooster &#8211; are there particular historical figures these characters refer to (i.e. Father Fox = Oren)?<span>&#160; </span>5. This story serves to highlight an interesting idea: University, in their endless fight with the Legion, may have actually pushed them into doing all those terrible horrible things University condemns them for.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;If all cannot have it, then none shall have it.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>(<strong>SPOILER</strong>) Two things are interesting with this: first off, the fact that, somehow, the &#8220;side effect&#8221; of Shauna being successful in what Oren&#8217;s called her for has worked its way into legend &#8211; the end of the world.<span>&#160; </span>Secondly, knowing Oren&#8217;s true goals as we now do, it&#8217;s interesting to see how they&#8217;ve been romanticized by not only his followers, but by the culture at large. <span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- It&#8217;s not meant to be particularly funny, but&#8230;I still snicker at Arkahn&#8217;s tone when she responds to Cheanti&#8217;s inquiry about the story.<span>&#160; </span>Despite being tied up, blindfolded, and beaten, she is still not having <strong>any</strong> of this.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I love how the Father Fox story brings to the forefront the fact that regret and consequences are such a huge part of the larger narrative of 2S.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;I have much to regret&#8230;yet I could have much <em>more</em> were I not blindfolded and tied to a chair.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>This is kind of the way Arkahn acknowledges that, while she wronged this woman, the way Cheanti is seeking her revenge really makes her no better than Arkahn ever was.<span>&#160; </span><s>Also Arkahn you are the biggest badass and you will go down swinging and I love you so very very much for it</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- And before I forget, Christina is pulling at least triple-duty in this episode, and absolutely <strong><em>owns</em></strong> it.<span>&#160; </span>Zana is wonderful, as always, but her work playing Cheanti is so good it&#8217;s downright spooky.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I sort of love how Dita refuses to let Fesmer ever undermine her authority, even before we really meet her.<span>&#160; </span>She&#8217;s a person who grew up alongside power and prominent leaders, and she knows very well how to wield her own authority &#8211; just because he&#8217;s her boyfriend doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;ll let Fesmer off the hook when he doubts her!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Oh jeez, you can practically hear the smile on Fesmer&#8217;s face when he says Dita&#8217;s name.<span>&#160; </span><s>I just have a lot of feelings about these characters and their happiness, I&#8217;m sorry</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Is this the very first time Mike and Jareth have apologized to one another?<span>&#160; </span>My god, I think it is!<span>&#160; </span><a href="http://someone%20get%20some%20confetti%20Im%20throwing%20a%20party" target="_blank">#someone get me some confetti</a> <a href="http://someone%20get%20some%20confetti%20Im%20throwing%20a%20party" target="_blank">#I&#8217;m throwing a party</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;You could have just used the door, Jareth!&#8221; &#8220;Yeeees, but after I put all that effort into studying explosives I thought, hmm, why not use them?&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>OH YOU TWO.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Stochiani is&#8230;really, really unsubtle about those bomb schematics, isn&#8217;t he?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Say what you want about the false group of Hunters, but dang, they are really good at rolling with the punches.<span>&#160; </span>Not only did they manage to capture two &#8220;assistants&#8221; that Cheanti has a personal grudge against, but they manipulate a University official to get them right inside the place they need to be to make their plan work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;I expected you two to meet with no success.<span>&#160; </span>It is fortunate that your results allow us to begin our search so quickly.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>&#8220;Thank you?&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>All that being said, they sure aren&#8217;t the nicest bunch.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Why are we always screwed?&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Because conflict is necessary for a compelling narrative, Mike!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;The cause is right &#8211; and that makes the difference!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>For all that they&#8217;re not an official branch of the Hunters of Truth, this seems to be the party line for much of what the Hunters do, which is perhaps why I am generally uncomfortable with their methods.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Y&#8217;know, Cheanti says she wants to damage University for failing to protect her and her family&#8230;but she <em>was</em> a criminal at the time, and was hurt by the other law-breakers she was working with.<span>&#160; </span>This is not to say that it was right that her husband was killed (and it was most certainly not right that she lost her child), but&#8230;was this not an established risk from the outset?<span>&#160; </span>A good deal of her anger is justified, yes, but it also seems like she&#8217;s projecting some of the guilt she feels onto University, and onto Katherine and Arkahn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Before we get to our explosive conclusion&#8230;wow, I didn&#8217;t even mean to do that, sorry&#8230;anyway, before we get to that point, can I point out the music in this episode?<span>&#160; </span>Because DAMN.<span>&#160; </span>Every piece serves to heighten the emotional pitch of its given scene &#8211; the torture scene is more frightening, the battles more frantic, and the ending more tense, all due to the music, and I LOVE it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Ignoring the fact that Katherine really isn&#8217;t in a state to help lift someone, perhaps it would&#8217;ve been better if Jareth had just let her help Mike out of the tae-oden vat.<span>&#160; </span>I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s completely impervious to tae-oden the way Mike is, but she&#8217;s even less attuned than Jareth, due to her almost complete lack of exposure to Odi.<span>&#160; </span><a href="http://Things%20that%20are%20pointless%20but%20that%20CT%20still%20thinks%20about" target="_blank">#Things that are pointless but that CT still thinks about</a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Y&#8217;know, they may fight constantly, but in the end, Mike and Jareth will defend each other to the death.<span>&#160; </span>If that isn&#8217;t a sign of friendship, I don&#8217;t know what is.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;What happened to your hands, Katherine?!&#8221; &#8220;I&#8230;earned this.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>The woman&#8217;s been tied up, beaten, had her hands shattered, and was forced to help in an act of terrorism against her will&#8230;and she still feels guilty.<span>&#160; </span>Note, though, that after this point in the series, she starts getting a little better about that guilt; if I had to guess, I&#8217;d say that being forced to open up and start talking about these things by the events of this episode will be good for her.<span>&#160; </span>Of course, it probably doesn&#8217;t hurt that Cheanti, for all her claims of forgiveness, doesn&#8217;t give a bit about whether they die or not.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Zana and Garvin are very similar people, in that they&#8217;re both older mentor figures with interesting pasts who&#8217;ve taken several talented but troubled young people under their wing and are helping them to accomplish their goals.<span>&#160; </span>However, there&#8217;s one very, very big difference between them: while Zana kept certain aspects of her history to herself, she never once lied to her children to motivate them, like Garvin has.<span>&#160; </span>Is that the key to why her group survives and Garvin&#8217;s does not?<span>&#160; </span>Who&#8217;s to say?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- A lesson for all: if you can&#8217;t put aside your bickering and work together long enough to do what needs to be done?<span>&#160; </span><em>People pay the price</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Ugh, Arkahn corralling Jareth and Fesmer so they can all work together, why do you make my heart swell with love and pride?<span>&#160; </span>It just makes me so happy to see Arkahn working side-by-side with her boys again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;If there was anything left unsaid, now would be the time to say it.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>(<strong>SPOILER</strong>) Oh, Zana <em>KNOWS</em>.<span>&#160; </span>She totally knows!<span>&#160; </span>She&#8217;s knows Katherine too well, has had too much experience with old friends working together on difficult journeys not to know.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- All known props in the universe to Neil for the sound effects of that explosion.<span>&#160; </span>That was not just some same-y old boom right there &#8211; that was an EXPLOSION.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Aaaand I just hit 6 pages in Word.<span>&#160; </span>In the immortal words of Julia Lunetta: &#8220;Woo-hoo!<span>&#160; </span>I&#8217;m goin&#8217; home.&#8221;</p>&#13;
