                        &#13;
                        <p/><p class="MsoNormal">Seeing as this is the last day, the last few hours even, before the finale, I thought I&#8217;d post this little essay I&#8217;ve been sitting on.&#160; I&#8217;ve been reflecting on why I care so much about this story and these characters, and I thought you guys might like to know why it means so much to me.<!-- more --></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Okay.<span>&#160; </span>So.<span>&#160; </span>I discovered <em>Second Shift </em>in 2007, during what may end up being one of the lowest points in my life.<span>&#160; </span>I returned home from college in June of that year to a house that had been thrown into chaos. <span>&#160;</span>Unbeknownst to me, my parents were getting a divorce, we&#8217;d moved, my father was leaving the state, and everyone was miserable.<span>&#160; </span>Too soon after that, I left the country for Japan, where I then lived for 4 months.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I was&#8230;well, looking back on it now, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that I was depressed.<span>&#160; </span>I was in a new country, and even though I could speak the language, it was difficult to really enjoy anything.<span>&#160; </span>I slept constantly, making friends became harder and harder, and some days I just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to leave my room.<span>&#160; </span>I had this constant loop in my head about how my family had worked really hard to afford this opportunity, and I was squandering it, and that made me worse, so I just was talking less and less and&#8230;it was awful.<span>&#160; </span>I didn&#8217;t want to be in Japan, but I didn&#8217;t want to be at home either.&#160; I was torn between two places that I simultaneously wanted and didn&#8217;t want to be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And in the midst of this was <em>Second Shift</em>, a story about a group of kids almost exactly my age trapped in another world, and the characters want to go home but they want to stay too and it was&#8230;it was everything I felt.<span>&#160; </span>Home had problems, stress and work and overly demanding parents and abusive exes; Laundi was wonderful but awful too, and it just wasn&#8217;t home.<span>&#160; </span>The characters were just as torn as I was.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, random rambling feelings aside, <em>Second Shift </em>just&#8230;made me feel less lonely, I guess.<span>&#160; </span>For all that they were fictional, Shauna and Mike and Katherine comforted me.<span>&#160; </span>Fesmer and Jareth and Arkahn made me not give up.<span>&#160; </span>And Zana never made me feel bad about my failures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Long story short: I eventually went back home and built myself back up again.<span>&#160; </span>I was amazingly lucky, and life got better!<span>&#160; </span>I can look back on 2007 with more than just regret.<span> </span>But I&#8217;ve never forgotten that low place&#8230;and I will never forget who and what helped me then.<span> <br/></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So to all the 2S cast and crew, thank you.<span>&#160; </span>Thank you for all the work you&#8217;ve done, and the amazing story you put together, and just&#8230;thanks for being awesome.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s made all the difference.</p>&#13;
