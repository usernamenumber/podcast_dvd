<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Recap!</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fight has finally blown over, and the whole of Zana&#8217;s staff , when they&#8217;re not dealing with all of Zana&#8217;s new business, are abuzz over the approaching New Year.<span>&#160; </span>Turns out a dance is coming up, and it&#8217;s tradition to attend with a partner.<span>&#160; </span>Jareth runs into Shauna and, after announcing his promotion to Instructor at University, nervously asks her to attend the dance with him.<span>&#160; </span>She accepts, and tells Katherine and Mike as much on her way to talk to Zana about her nightmares.<span>&#160; </span>Zana, for perhaps the first time since we&#8217;ve met her, is unsure of exactly how to help Shauna, advising her solely to run.<span>&#160; </span>In between that and everyone&#8217;s inquiring about the Shift spell, Shauna&#8217;s starting to get jumpy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Mike, a little put-out that Jareth beat him to asking Shauna to the dance, nonetheless invites a pleasantly surprised Arkahn; Katherine is in turn asked by Fesmer, and accepts (though not enthusiastically).<span>&#160; </span>At the dance, mild drama ensues - Jareth and Shauna wander off and start discussing philosophy, but eventually give in to their long-running romantic tension as Jareth kisses her.<span>&#160; </span>Arkahn and Mike start cutting up the dance floor, generally enjoying themselves, but the evening takes a turn for the worse when Mike spots just how much fun Shauna and Jareth are having.<span>&#160; </span>Fesmer desperately tries to get Katherine to loosen up, but it all backfires when she has to deal with him after he&#8217;s had just a bit too much.<span>&#160; </span>Nonetheless, the gang return home that night mostly happy, but a little melancholy over how their time together is drawing to a close.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Meek and I made them, hundreds of them, thousands of them!<span>&#160; </span>I have not slept in DAYS!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>I always have to pause the episode right here, not even 3 minutes in, because I&#8217;m laughing too hard to hear what comes next.<span>&#160; </span>Every.<span>&#160; </span>Single.<span>&#160; </span>Time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Wait, wait, wait&#8230;Laundian crops rely on the Odi surge to finally be ready for harvest?<span>&#160; </span>Oh dear&#8230;<strong>(SPOILER) </strong>We&#8217;ve been getting hints in Season 2 that destroying Oren may have a huge impact on Amarand and the way it uses Odi&#8230;if even the crops can&#8217;t grow without it, they may be in more trouble than I&#8217;d initially assumed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Y&#8217;know, I think Shauna and Fesmer are the only female/male pairing in 2S for which there was never any romantic tension, real or imagined.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Ugh, it almost hurts to listen to Shauna and Fes chatting, knowing where their relationship is going to end up.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I love the subtle ways we see that Shauna is fraying from her lack of sleep, her nightmares, and her stress over Shift; even when she&#8217;s in a good mood, she still jumps at everything.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Nowadays, the Mr. Ham song gets stuck in my head more often than the original Mr. Plow version.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Okay, I&#8217;m sorry, but Jareth&#8217;s asking Shauna to the dance may just be the most adorable thing of all time. <span>&#160;</span><s>NEWSFLASH ChonklaTime thinks everything Jareth does is adorable, when the hell is she going to shut up about it?</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I&#8230;may or may not have reacted the <em>exact same way</em> as Jareth when my now-S.O. first called to ask me out.<span>&#160; </span>And I do mean exact.<span>&#160; </span><s>Second Shift has taken over my brain WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Just a brief interjection here: you may have noticed I&#8217;m gushing a little bit about this episode.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s just&#8230;I just love it so much.<span>&#160; </span>1.09 and 1.10 are perhaps together my favorite episodes out of the whole of Season 1.<span>&#160; </span><em>Civil War</em> takes all the conflicts that have built over the previous 8 episodes and brings them to fruition with a giant fight; <em>The Dance</em> then resolves many of these issues and gives us almost our last truly happy moments before all hell breaks loose.<span>&#160; </span>I love that Second Shift takes the time to slow down the plot, just to give us some time to have fun with these characters, before the season finale.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Again, both Mike and Katherine are right here: Zana&#8217;s business is thriving and will continue to do so, but introducing foreign marketing concepts is going to alter the face of Laundi.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Shauna&#8217;s slightly off-base here: Mike and Katherine aren&#8217;t arguing here&#8230;or, at least, they&#8217;re not <em>really</em> arguing, not like the last time.<span>&#160; </span>Really, it&#8217;s more playfully bantering than anything else, which may be why I enjoy their interactions so very, very much.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Looking back, I can understand why Shauna was so mad when (SPOILER) Mike and Katherine come back to Laundi.<span>&#160; </span>They really have no concept of how hard she worked to send them home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I love how quickly Katherine jumps to Shauna&#8217;s rescue when Mike starts to pry into her romantic affairs.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s really clear that she&#8217;s aware of how uncomfortable Mike&#8217;s crush makes Shauna, and she&#8217;s so quick to protect her.<span>&#160; </span>Ugh, their friendship makes me so <em>happy</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;There was a ship?&#8221; Excuse me while I LAUGH FOREVER.<span>&#160; </span>Brandon and John, I love you guys.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;There are many strange things out there, both wonderful&#8230;and terrible.<span>&#160; </span>And there is often truth behind legends&#8230;&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>There is so much weight behind Zana&#8217;s words now that we know more of her story.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s heartbreaking how much of herself she&#8217;s holding back from her children, all for the sake of protecting them.<span>&#160; </span>And so it makes sense that she advises Shauna to run away; she&#8217;s telling her to do what Zana wished she had done all those years ago &#8211; her one greatest regret.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Zana has allowed herself to get attached to so few people, and hardly ever expresses her own negative emotions to anyone other than Targonane&#8230;she must really be in a lot of pain to tell Shauna how much she will miss them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I think it&#8217;s a testament to how much Arkahn likes Mike that she accepts his invitation to the dance.<span>&#160; </span>I mean, she&#8217;s trying her best not to get attached to the Boston Trio; they&#8217;re completely altering the nature of her <strong>(SPOILER)</strong> undercover work and chances are good that their either going to leave Laundi forever or be captured by the Legion.<span>&#160; </span>So the fact that she puts all this aside to attend the dance with Mike speaks volumes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Seriously, look at how skillful Katherine is at slipping out of conflict: Fesmer wants to know why she&#8217;s upset, and she turns it back on him, insulting him solely so she won&#8217;t have to face the problem of Arkahn head-on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I get the distinct feeling that Katherine has heard this &#8220;I&#8217;ll be the one to cheer up the beautiful gloomy girl&#8221; before.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Do you really want to know?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I am keenly interested!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>I&#8217;ll bet you are, Arkahn, but probably not for the same reasons Shauna <em>thinks</em> you are.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- This episode marks Tiven Weinstock&#8217;s debut, and man, what an introduction.<span>&#160; </span>Tiven&#8217;s music is a big part of what makes Second Shift so special &#8211; it&#8217;s not just random, generic fantasy music, it&#8217;s written to accentuate particular scenes, or even moments in scenes, and it&#8217;s pretty much all beautifully done.<span>&#160; </span>The music for the dance, for instance, creates a sense of&#8230;hmmm, &#8220;not-quite-home&#8221;-ness.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s not entirely alien, but it&#8217;s not exactly like anything we&#8217;ve ever heard before.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s music that you can <em>believe</em> came from an entirely different culture from our own.<span>&#160; </span>At the same time, the music emotionally supports every scene that happens during the dance sequence.<span>&#160; </span>Fantastic stuff!<span>&#160; </span>(Also, I desperately need the second piece, the one Mike and Arkahn dance to, as a download.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I notice that Mike is at his absolutely most charming towards Arkahn&#8230;while in front of Shauna.<span>&#160; </span>Hmmm&#8230;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I think this is our first mention of how active items are becoming more and more advanced recently, as well as the first time we hear of factories outside of Laundi.<span>&#160; </span>All of this will, of course, come back to bite us in the ass.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Awkward Jareth = my <strong>favorite</strong> thing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Katherine is incredibly distracted throughout the entire dance, and I don&#8217;t think we ever get a definitive reason why.<span>&#160; </span>Is it just that she doesn&#8217;t like large social events like this?<span>&#160; </span>Or is there a deeper reason she&#8217;s so preoccupied?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Not gonna lie, even though I know Mike &amp; Arkahn&#8217;s relationship never really got off the ground, the two of them dancing together is absolutely adorable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Y&#8217;know, I think I just figured out why Shauna could never see Mike as something more than a friend and surrogate younger brother &#8211; she&#8217;s attracted to men who push her intellectually. <span>&#160;</span>Seriously, look at her interactions with Jareth <strong>(SPOILER) </strong>and Porec: before any romance ensues, there&#8217;s some serious debating and arguing going on.<span>&#160; </span>Mike is too smitten with Shauna to challenge her on&#8230;well, anything, so he gets Friend Zoned.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- That being said&#8230;ouch.<span>&#160; </span>Poor Mike.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s no fun watching your unrequited love pursue other people, <s>particularly not as vigorously as Shauna is currently pursuing Jareth!</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Mother always told me not to let a girl&#8217;s plate be cleared or her glass emptied!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Oh man, I always loved the echo of this line a few episodes down the road; so delightfully subtle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Oh, Drunk!Fesmer.<span>&#160; </span>You&#8217;re the best.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;She is very sad.<span>&#160; </span>And very beautiful.<span>&#160; </span>&#8230;That is all.&#8221;<span>&#160;</span><span> </span>In vino veritas, I suppose, because I think Fesmer realized this even before us the audience.<span>&#160; </span>Katherine is, in truth, a very lonely person, which I don&#8217;t think we quite realize until the beginning of Season 2.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;For my part, it is&#8230;good to have pleasant company.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>That little weighted pause right there says quite a bit about the nature of Arkahn&#8217;s relationship with her parents.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Arkahn and Shauna&#8217;s joking at the end of this episode is on the one hand hilarious, but on the other, very sad.<span>&#160; </span>Their relationship as friends is, after all, about to come to an end.</p>&#13;
