<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><!-- more -->Recap:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Shauna awakes from being knocked out to discover that she is now in a delightfully dank dungeon.<span>&#160; </span>She&#8217;s not alone, though; Mike and Katherine are in their own cells, as is Fesmer&#8230;not that they can talk to him, as their translation pendants have been confiscated.<span>&#160; </span>On top of that, the two resident mages have had their powers blocked by the use of tae-oden.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before they can figure anything else out, though, a guard comes to collect Shauna, and takes her to meet the man in charge.<span>&#160; </span>Turns out he&#8217;s a rather polite, friendly guy who wants to talk to Shauna about her phenomenal powers &#8211; and he also happens to be Fesmer&#8217;s supposedly dead brother, Porec.<span>&#160; </span>Turns out Fesmer&#8217;s family, including his dead father, were prominently placed in the Legion&#8230;and the recently captured Jareth knew.<span>&#160; </span>In the meantime, Arkahn also comes to talk first to Shauna, then Mike, but they reject her outright, saying that, despite her protestations, she did have a choice in what happened.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After one last creepy dream involving the Herald, Shauna wakes to find Arkahn setting her and the others free after distracting the guards with Undying.<span>&#160; </span>The group tries to fight their way out, but Fesmer is seriously wounded in the process, and he and Jareth separate off while Shauna goes to Shift the others.<span>&#160; </span>After realizing that this world and our own are not so far apart, Shauna Shifts first Mike, then Katherine, all while being set upon by Undying.<span>&#160; </span>Back in our own world, they and Tyler anxiously await Shauna&#8217;s arrival &#8211; and are shocked when the last person to arrive is a sobbing Arkahn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Okay, for the record?<span>&#160; </span>I LOVE this first scene.<span>&#160; </span>I honestly don&#8217;t think it would have worked as well in any other medium.<span>&#160; </span>The fact that 2S is an audiodrama means that we the audience can <em>feel</em> Shauna&#8217;s isolation, more than we would be able to on a screen or a page; Mike and Katherine and Fesmer are there, but they&#8217;re separated, their voices muted. <span>&#160;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I love how Mike, who does his best to maintain his self-image as this dumb, fun-loving jock, occasionally slips and references some pretty nerdy things.<span>&#160; </span>I was a little taken aback when he mentioned The Count of Monte Cristo, for instance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- UGH I love Charendraen.<span>&#160; </span>Caileb&#8217;s yelling at Shauna is just so damn natural-sounding, it&#8217;s the best.<span>&#160; </span>(Also, this will definitely not be the last time I say this, but I love love LOVE how everything that&#8217;s happened in the preceding 12 episodes all comes back in this finale &#8211; for instance, Katherine&#8217;s painfully slow learning of Charendraen, allowing her to communicate with Fesmer.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Okay, so: Porec.<span>&#160; </span>I sort of adore how, when Caileb is leading Shauna to his office, you&#8217;re completely expecting a scenery-chewing, blatantly wicked villain like Arkahn&#8217;s parents &#8211; and then you get there, and Porec&#8217;s just this completely normal guy.<span>&#160; </span>Even better, he introduces himself in such a matter-of-fact way that you almost completely don&#8217;t remember who he is until Fesmer enters the scene.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;I think we&#8217;re being downgraded to a B-plot.&#8221; This episode, despite the fact that it&#8217;s the finale, does a nice, subtle job of pointing out that Mike and Katherine&#8230;well, they really haven&#8217;t done much.<span>&#160; </span>Oh, they&#8217;ve worked and formed relationships and all, but they&#8217;re not <em>in it</em> the way that Shauna is.<span>&#160; </span>That&#8217;s the real difference between Seasons 1 and 2, I think.<span>&#160; </span>Season 1 was about building this world, and getting to know the people, and Shauna doing the work.<span>&#160; </span>Season 2 is the mirror of that, where now that they&#8217;ve built the world they send their characters out into it, and now that we know these people we&#8217;re going to see how they react to their trials, and instead of Shauna doing all the work, it&#8217;s now Katherine and Mike&#8217;s turn to go out and work and suffer and grow.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Andrew does a straight-up AMAZING job in this episode; as we go along, it&#8217;s apparent that Fesmer is so shocked, his world-view so turned upside-down, that he&#8217;s just barely restraining himself from screaming and punching people in the face.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Okay.<span>&#160; </span>There is something kind of small and subtle about Second Shift that I love, and probably no one else has noticed it, and it makes me kind of weird and all, but here it is: Shauna, on no less than 3 separate occasions, makes references to the fact that she is <em>not thin</em>.<span>&#160; </span>The degree to which she is <em>not thin</em> is never established, but she fully embraces the fact that she is, at the very least, kinda chubby.<span>&#160; </span>And not only is she the most powerful character on the show, but no less than 3 other characters over the course of 13 episodes out-and-out call her beautiful.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s not played for laughs.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s not ironic.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s not a joke.<span>&#160; </span>Shauna is not thin, and she is beautiful.<span>&#160; </span>That&#8217;s all there is to it.<span>&#160; </span><strong><em>And I love that</em></strong>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Oh man, I never realized that Porec made mention of the fact that the Herald has come to others before.<strong>&#160; (SPOILER) </strong>It&#8217;s not &#8216;til nearly the end of Season 2 that we find out that Shauna is not the first person Oren has chosen, but that point was threaded all the way back in this episode!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Goodbye, Shaena.<span>&#160; </span>I enjoyed being your friend&#8230;however briefly.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>This, right here, is something that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever heard any other show do quite as well as Second Shift does.<span>&#160; </span>Right now (on their first listen-through, at least), the audience is primed and ready to HATE Arkahn.<span>&#160; </span>She&#8217;s betrayed everyone we care about into the hands of the Bad Guys.<span>&#160; </span>And yet&#8230;Arkahn herself is never caricaturized or villainized.<span>&#160; </span>The narrative allows her to be regretful and conflicted without ever denying Shauna her right to be furious.<span>&#160; </span>It doesn&#8217;t push us to agree with one of them or the other, it just gives us the full story.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;It may not be a beautiful Truth&#8230;but it is a practical one.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>This was the line where Porec started to win me over, just a little bit.<span>&#160; </span>Because even if I don&#8217;t agree with his philosophy, this is a pretty reasonable view of one&#8217;s own faith.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- It&#8217;s important that it was established earlier on that Shauna really, really enjoys philosophical debates, because if it hadn&#8217;t, her succumbing to debating with &#8220;the villain&#8221; would&#8217;ve had a very different tone to it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I really enjoy Mike and Arkahn&#8217;s discussion here.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s all very Mike; even when talking about something completely serious, he still peppers in his little quips, just to keep himself calm.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Read that once&#8230;maybe it&#8217;s even true!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Oh, <em>Mike</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Jareth says &#8220;painstick&#8221; the <em>exact same way</em> that Katherine did back in 1.08, and I find that <em>hilarious</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;She betrayed us.<span>&#160; </span>She is Legion scum&#8230;nothing more.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Up until this point, we&#8217;ve really only gotten hints of Fesmer&#8217;s inability to see beyond the black and white morality of things, but now we&#8217;ve got our first real clue on where he&#8217;s going to go from here.<span>&#160; </span>Despite the fact that Arkahn has been his close friend for years, he&#8217;s willing to completely and totally dismiss her as one of the bad guys, to the point of not caring whether she lives or dies, without even hearing her out.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Guys, I love you, but maybe we shouldn&#8217;t have philosophical discussions about weapon usage while <em>trying to escape from a dungeon</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;She said she freed Undying to distract the others.&#8221; &#8220;Yeah, &#8216;cause that won&#8217;t backfire&#8230;&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Alas, if only genre-savviness could help you now, Katherine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Will you yield?&#8221; &#8220;Absolutely not!&#8221; &#8220;You should not be so&#8230;inflexible.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>I am going to completely refrain from commenting on how impossibly sexy this line is.<span>&#160; </span>COMPLETELY REFRAIN.<span>&#160; </span><s>GodDAMN, Jareth</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I really wish the writers had had more time to expand on some of the things that came up from this episode, particularly Mike&#8217;s reaction to killing the Legionnaire.<span>&#160; </span>I mean, in this episode alone the ideas are fascinating: Mike&#8217;s always been the guy who never holds back, and in the course of 15 minutes he&#8217;s forced to face the real repercussions of charging ahead without thinking.<span>&#160; </span>The affects of real violence on someone who <em>thinks</em> he&#8217;s prepared for it are fascinating, and I would&#8217;ve loved to hear more about it.<span>&#160; </span>Alas, if wishes were horses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Dang, Jareth is a scary guy when he wants to be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Yeah, well, I&#8217;m Mike, son of get the HELL out of my way!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Not gonna lie, despite how heavy everything is at this point, I still sort of snicker at this line.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I kind of forgot, during Season 2, that Porec was legitimately going to kill Katherine and Mike.<span>&#160; </span><strong>(SPOILER)</strong> The fact that they&#8217;ve accepted him as much as they did when he joined their party speaks wonders, not only to what they&#8217;re willing to put up with to find Shauna, but also to Katherine&#8217;s growing ability to forgive others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Okay, so we know from the conversation between Shauna and the Herald that our world and Amarand are practically on top of one another&#8230;but what are they to one another, really?<span>&#160; </span>Alternate universes?<span>&#160; </span>Ugh, I want to know!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Oh man, I remember the first time I listened to this episode &#8211; that terrible, heart-wrenching moment when you realize that Shauna isn&#8217;t there&#8230;and then Arkahn starts sobbing.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s awful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And that, ladies and gents, is Season One!<span>&#160; </span>I&#8217;m going to pause in my recaps &#8216;til Monday, because I&#8217;d love to cover Season Two with the full knowledge of what&#8217;s going to happen in the finale.<span>&#160; </span>In the meantime, I&#8217;ve got some 2S-related stuff for at least tomorrow and Saturday, and&#8230;well, I&#8217;m going to take Sunday off in order to 1. Wait for the finale, 2. Listen to the finale, and 3. SOB FOREVER.</p>&#13;
