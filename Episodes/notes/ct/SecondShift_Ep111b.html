<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><!-- more -->Recap:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This episode fills in some of the gaps in Retreat &#8211; namely, the stories everyone told on that last night around the campfire.<span>&#160; </span>Fesmer starts out by telling the story of an epic prank played by his brother Porec and Jareth a number of years ago (though the story is quickly co-opted by Jareth, who demands the story be told truthfully).<span>&#160; </span>In the tale, a young Jareth steals one of his grandfather&#8217;s books of magic and tries to impress Porec with a spell.<span>&#160; </span>He accidentally sends all of the village animals into estrus, enraging the villagers.<span>&#160; </span>Though amusing, it was only through Porec&#8217;s sole acceptance of the blame that Jareth&#8217;s reputation was saved, thereby allowing him to attend University some years later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Katherine relates the story of how she met Shauna and Mike during their Freshman Orientation: Shauna and her family took Katherine in with open arms, and Mike just refused to go away.<span>&#160; </span>Together, the three of them competed in a scavenger hunt that took them all over Boston, requiring them to swipe small items and take pictures of local landmarks.<span>&#160; </span>Mike&#8217;s very expensive camera, crucial to the hunt, is nearly confiscated by a security guard, but thanks to Katherine&#8217;s shameless flirting with said guard, they were able to get it back.<span>&#160; </span>Though they didn&#8217;t win, this marked the first time the Trio had to work together.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fesmer, assisted by Arkahn, tells the tale of Arkahn&#8217;s first days working at Zana&#8217;s shop.<span>&#160; </span>Fesmer quickly warmed to the shy (and rather nervous) Arkahn, even going so far as to take her to Zana&#8217;s cellar to show her one of his spells.<span>&#160; </span>He accidentally causes the stored vegetables to come to life; while initially amusing, things take a quick turn for the worse when the chaos causes the kitchen to light on fire.<span>&#160; </span>The pair are only saved by the timely arrival of Jareth, who extinguishes the fire&#8230;and then proceeds to lecture them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The stories all told, Katherine, Mike, and Shauna quietly discuss what they&#8217;ll do when they get home&#8230;and how much they&#8217;ll miss these new friends they&#8217;ve made in Laundi.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- This marks our very first time hearing Ari Herbstman in the role of Fesmer, and is the entire reason I was confident he could take on that mantle when Andrew had to step down in Season 2.<span>&#160; </span>They both play the part admirably!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I get the distinct sense that Mike&#8217;s got a running narrative going through his head at almost all times that sounds exactly like his opening monologue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Which of us was guided by a creepy oracle to study magic and invent a spell to send you home?&#8221; &#8220;Send <strong><em>us</em></strong> home.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s what I said.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>We&#8217;re in the middle of some rapid-fire exposition to sum up a season of plot for an audience who&#8217;ve never heard the show before, and somehow the writers still find time to keep characterization and motives entirely accurate.<span>&#160; </span>MY HEART, SHE DANCES.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I haven&#8217;t listened to his episode as many times as the others, since it&#8217;s not on my iPod.<span>&#160; </span>So it&#8217;s nice to relisten and appreciate all the nifty little tricks the writers are using to catch the audience up on the story.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- The full version of the Mr. Ham song makes me laugh so hard I start tearing up.<span>&#160; </span>Hand to god.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;So the monster in my dreams&#8230;maybe that&#8217;s what actually summoned us.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>This is the very first time someone connects the Herald to the spell that brought our Trio from Boston, and it&#8217;s pretty darn on the money.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;I have assembled the remaining pieces from the scandalized talk of the townfolk that I have managed to overhear by completely honest means.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Fesmer, you are the greatest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I love how it&#8217;s made very clear that Jareth&#8217;s dedication to study and urge to live up to his grandfather&#8217;s reputation are nothing new; they&#8217;ve been a part of his personality for literally decades.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Our first exposure to Porec (chronologically, at least), and it&#8217;s already demonstrated that he&#8217;s big on teaching and pushing others.<span>&#160; </span>Interesting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Your family has been naught but trouble since the day you arrived!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Hmm&#8230;how much did the townsfolk know about Fesmer&#8217;s family?<span>&#160; </span>Was Fesmer the <em>only</em> <em>one</em> who didn&#8217;t know about his father and brother?<span>&#160; </span>If so, I can understand why he went a little bit off the deep end in the year between Seasons 1 and 2.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;At times, protecting others&#8230;protecting our friends&#8230;can require certain sacrifices.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Hey Jareth, way to point out one of the major themes of your development next season!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I wonder &#8211; how much did Porec know of his father&#8217;s &#8220;business&#8221; at this point?<span>&#160; </span>He was at least 14 at this point, so he had to know something, I suppose.<span>&#160; </span><strong>(SPOILER)</strong> The reason I bring this up: Porec is, heart and soul, dedicated to Oren and the Brotherhood&#8230;but he still took the blame so Jareth could be accepted to University.<span>&#160; </span>If Porec was as dedicated then as he is now, that means he took undeserved punishment so that someone could attend a school that is the enemy of his faith &#8211; all for the sake of Jareth&#8217;s dream.<span>&#160; </span>That speaks miles about his personality.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Now there are 6 Browns instead of 7!<span>&#160; </span>(This has always and will always confuse me.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Mike, do you really imagine me as the pillow fight type?&#8221; &#8220;I have a <em>very</em> active imagination&#8230;&#8221; Okay, I won&#8217;t get into it here <s>doubtless you won&#8217;t be able to get me to shut up about it down the line</s>, but this really demonstrates one of the things I enjoy about Mike and Katherine &#8211; with the sole exception of the fight in <em>Civil War</em>, there&#8217;s always an undertone of playfulness to their fighting.<span>&#160; </span>Even when they finally become friends, they never really stop bickering, and&#8230;well, let&#8217;s face it, they&#8217;re (presumably) straight 20-somethings, so there&#8217;s a lot of hormones in the air, even when they can&#8217;t stand one another.<span>&#160; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I find it kind of interesting how Katherine&#8217;s story of her arrival in Boston with almost nothing and Shauna&#8217;s subsequent taking her in mirrors Katherine&#8217;s going back to find Shauna after the upcoming year gap.<span>&#160; </span>She may want to move on, but Katherine can&#8217;t just abandon Shauna all alone; on a certain level, she probably feels like she needs to repay that debt.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;I just wanted to introduce you to Mike.<span>&#160; </span>The minute I met him I knew the two of you would hit it off!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>To be perfectly fair to Shauna&#8230;well, she was kind of right.<span>&#160; </span>It just took&#8230;what, nearly 3 years?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- If nothing else, Katherine&#8217;s story points out something that tends to get lost in the bickering and nerd jokes: Shauna, Katherine, and Mike work together almost alarmingly well as a team.<span>&#160; </span><strong>(SPOILER)</strong> Oren may be the big bad, but I kinda feel sorry for him, because I have faith that the Boston Trio will find some way to mess him up big time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- In Season 2, Katherine jokes once or twice about using her feminine &#8220;wiles&#8221; to get the gang out of a scrape.<span>&#160; </span>Listening to this, though?<span>&#160; </span>I bet she could actually do it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I really like the break-down of how University is different from the American concept of a University.<span>&#160; </span>Don&#8217;t ask me why, but I do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Hmm&#8230;Arkahn notes that she started working at Zana&#8217;s almost 4 years ago.<span>&#160; </span>Seeing as she&#8217;d just been &#8220;rejected&#8221; from University, and that one applies around the age of 15, that would put her at 19 years old &#8211; exactly the same as the Bostonians.<span>&#160; </span>It also implies something that I should have figured out a while ago; namely, that Laundians start working pretty early in life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;I suspect they were not fully aware of Fesmer&#8217;s&#8230;eccentricities.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>LIES LIES LIES.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Had you honestly expected Zana to <em>cane</em> you for being 5 minutes late?&#8221; Oh man, this has some really nasty connotations re: Arkahn and her parents, because the answer to his question here is <em>YES</em>.<span>&#160; </span>Yes, Fesmer, she did expect to be beaten, because that&#8217;s all she had experienced before: strict rules and brutal punishments. <span>&#160;</span><s>Ugh, I could just push Lorenalark and Alexalark off something high for how they treated Arkahn</s></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Oh god, I love how Fesmer delights in messing with Arkahn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Jeez, Arkahn is only 15 in this story, but look at how good she is at noticing details and prying for information.<span>&#160; </span>She gets more subtle with age, of course, but damn, she was good even then.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Are you attempting to access Odi?&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>&#8220;&#8230;perhaps.&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Ugh, adorable friends are ADORABLE.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I think this was our very first look, at least chronologically speaking, at how Arkahn is capable of augmenting and enhancing others&#8217; ability to spellcast.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Oh god, the entire sequence with Jareth arriving may be one of the funniest moments in Second Shift history, and &#8220;As you wish, take solace in your lies!&#8221; is one of the most brilliant pieces of dialog I&#8217;ve ever heard.<span>&#160; </span>Ari&#8217;s delivery is <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- All that being said&#8230;I totally buy Fesmer&#8217;s description of Arkahn being just a touch infatuated with Jareth when she was younger.<span>&#160; </span>She&#8217;s always sort of looked up to him a little, and, well&#8230;she was 15 at the time, and he was older, intelligent, and a University student.<span>&#160; </span>Makes sense.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;But Jareth did not know, and when the sun sinks beneath the horizon, what else truly matters?&#8221; &#8220;What indeed!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>I can&#8217;t help but picture Arkahn and Fesmer here, smiling and clinking glasses, as Jareth fumes next to them.<span>&#160; </span>It&#8217;s a wonderful image.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Random note about the recording &#8211; someone in the audience figures out the Snakes on a Plane reference about a minute after everybody else, and then proceeds to laugh completely out of the blue on his own.<span>&#160; </span>It makes me snort every time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Where you go, we follow.&#8221; &#8220;Your stalwart companions &#8216;til the end!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Ugh, THESE TWO.<span> Their dedication to Shauna is amazing.<br/></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;It&#8217;s slice of life&#8230;EPIC slice of life!&#8221;<span>&#160; </span>Couldn&#8217;t have described this show better myself, Mike.</p>&#13;
