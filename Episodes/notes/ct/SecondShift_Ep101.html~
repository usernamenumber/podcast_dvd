<strong>Recap </strong>:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Shauna Brown is a college sophomore in Boston who has, quite literally, no time for herself.&#160; In between going to school full time and caring for her 4 younger brothers, she works at a pizza joint along with Katherine Rinson, her super-achiever old roommate/best friend, and Mike Archer, the loveable dumb jock who&#8217;s got a not-so-secret crush on her.&#160; As she&#8217;s taking her teenage brother Tyler and their younger twin brothers home, Shauna learns she might actually get a night off, and heads out to the movies with Mike and Katherine.&#160; Things quickly go awry, though, as the trio hear mysterious chanting and are pulled through the ether into another world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our trio land with a thump in a lush forest outside a town called Laundi, and quickly encounter the people who brought them here: Fesmer, an impulsive but friendly mage, and his friend and coworker Arkahn, who tried her hardest to talk him out of casting this spell, and Jareth, a rather strict teaching assistant at the local University who is none too pleased to discover Fesmer using magic he isn&#8217;t trained in.&#160; Everyone&#8217;s bickering is soon broken up by the arrival of a group of Legionaires, the local &#8220;bad guys&#8221;, and the group split up and run.&#160; They eventually converge at the shop where the Laundians work, where Zana, the friendly old proprietress, takes the fact that 3 people just fell through time and space in stride, and invites everyone inside for dinner.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Comments: (may contain spoilers for the whole series!)</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Much as I love this show, I&#8217;ll admit that this first episode is a little rough.<span>&#160; </span>Getting into a good pace with a new project is HARD, and the creators struggled a little bit to get into that groove.<span>&#160; </span>The dialog, for instance, is way too fast and occasionally a little stilted, as if the actors are still trying to get a handle on the characters, the recording quality isn&#8217;t the greatest, and a LOT of exposition is crammed into one half hour.<span>&#160; </span>But if you consider that, at this point, many of the cast and crew were college kids doing this for fun, I find most of their slip-ups easy to forgive.<span>&#160; </span>Knowing just how good this is going to get down the line helps too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- All that being said, I love how well-defined the characters are, even from the outset.<span>&#160; </span>4 minutes in, and we already know a ton about them; Kathrine&#8217;s issues with her parents, Mike&#8217;s inability to take anything seriously, Shauna living entirely for others, it&#8217;s all in there.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- And here begins the Great 5<sup>th</sup> Brown Mystery: Shauna explicitly says that she has 4 brothers, and that she&#8217;s the eldest&#8230;but we only ever meet Tyler and the Twins.<span>&#160; </span>That&#8217;s 3 brothers.<span>&#160; </span>And (SUPER SPOILER ALERT) when her house burns down during her dream in Season 2, only 5 bodies are recovered: 2 parents, 3 brothers.<span>&#160; </span>So who the heck is that 5<sup>th</sup> Brown sibling?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Tyler is voiced by the same person who does Shauna, and I&#8217;m really glad they later figured out a way to deepen her voice more naturally, because it does sound a little wonky in this episode.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- CONFESSION: I&#8217;ve never actually listened to Captain Laserbeard.<span>&#160; </span>This clearly makes me a bad 2S fan.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I really appreciate that they never have to spell out how head-over-heels Mike is for Shauna; it&#8217;s all conveyed in the dialog.<span>&#160; </span>Because he is DELIGHTFULLY UNSUBTLE.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Ahhh, the first appearance of &#8220;No promises&#8221;.&#160; I fully blame the 2S writing crew for how often this phrase slips into my speech nowadays.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Charendraen is just&#8230;so awesome.<span>&#160; </span>This may be where the show first really grabbed my attention, because even on the first listen I could tell this wasn&#8217;t just gibberish.<span>&#160; </span>Charendraen is a constructed language, with its own grammar, syntax, and even idioms, along with a (relatively limited) vocabulary.<span>&#160; </span>So when we first hear Arkahn and Fesmer talking, it actually sounds like a conversation, as opposed to just so much meaningless noise.<span>&#160; </span>And in an audiodrama, where everything has to be conveyed through sound alone, having people speak with a constructed accent is a pretty useful way to suggest a sense of unfamiliarity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I love how quickly distracted Mike is by the shiny, shiny sword.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Looking back, I never realized that the reason Shauna is so discomfited by the point of origin spell is because she&#8217;s so strongly attuned.&#160; She&#8217;s always had her &#8220;Shauna sense&#8221;, but she&#8217;s just never experienced actual magic until this point.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- For all that the Foley has evolved over the years of the show, I still love the sound effect for the Waa-loren.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry we did not have time for a proper introduction.&#160; You may have noticed we are running for our lives.&#8221;&#160; Ah, Jareth and Katherine, the ship that sunk before it even left the harbor.&#160; A shame, really; I enjoy their interactions as two people who are too similar to ever really get along.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- SO.&#160; MUCH.&#160; RUNNING.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#9829;&#9829;&#9829;ZANA&#9829;&#9829;&#9829;&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;I bet they won&#8217;t even miss you!&#8221; &#8220;&#8230;I think Fesmer needs help with that fence, Mike.&#8221;&#160; Y&#8217;know, looking back, (SPOILER) Porec really did have a point: Shauna is literally incapable of thinking of herself and her family as independent units.&#160; The thought of them without her, or herself without them, is impossible to her.&#160;&#160; When it comes to character arcs that have stretched across the show, Shauna&#8217;s has been the opposite of Mike and Katherine; while they&#8217;ve grown up and learned to think of others, Shauna&#8217;s arc is about her learning to look inside herself and be confident on her own.&#160; Interesting to see how far back all of these arcs were seeded, is essentially what I&#8217;m saying.</p>&#13;
