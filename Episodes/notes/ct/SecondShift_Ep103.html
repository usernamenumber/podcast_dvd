<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Recap!</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><em>Stupid Magic </em>is a transitory episode, bridging us from the set-up in the pilot to the main action that&#8217;s coming up fast.&#160; Mike, Katherine, and Shauna start settling into their new lives in Laundi, including starting their work in Zana&#8217;s shop.&#160; Mike and Fesmer bond due to their mutual jovial personalities, while Katherine quickly starts seeing Zana as a mentor of sorts.&#160; Shauna and Arkahn start forming their own friendship, but Arkahn is quickly turning cold towards the Boston trio.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Shauna reveals that she knows how to get her friends home, but hides the fact that she will not be returning with them.&#160; Fesmer starts to teach her the basics of Odi, including that there are 2 forms of magic in Laundi: Natural, or Savage magic, which draws power solely from the user, and Ritual magic, which requires study and a physical guide, similar to an alchemical circle.&#160; Jareth stumbles on Fesmer&#8217;s lessons and flips out, as Fesmer&#8217;s Natural magic is technically illegal.&#160; While all this fighting is going on, Shauna struggles to use Odi at all, until finally, in a frustrated outburst, she manages to shove a pebble into the lake - something she shouldn&#8217;t be able to do after <em>days </em>of study, much less hours.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Comments: (may contain spoilers for the whole series!)</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Okay, so, <em>Stupid Magic </em>is pretty much where the series starts to gel nicely.&#160; People have pretty much figured out who their characters are, the Foley is starting to do some more of the heavy lifting, and while it doesn&#8217;t approach the <em>gorgeous</em> quality of later episodes, the audio has taken a pretty big jump forward from the pilot.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I love Mike&#8217;s opening conversation with the squirrel-thing.&#160; It&#8217;s very&#8230;Mike&#8230;of him.&#160; Also, it confirms that Mike truly believes that this world isn&#8217;t real, which is important in justifying his behavior in the next episode or two.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Looking back, Fesmer&#8217;s assertion that Natural magic is best performed by a person with a healthy body makes complete sense, since we later learn from Jareth that the body itself takes the place of an array in Natural magic.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Okay, &#8220;It is time to face the sun&#8221; has to be one of my favorite Charendraen idioms, along with &#8220;Never trust one who earns his soup on deceit.&#8221;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Ah, Zana and Katherine.&#160; Only 3 episodes in, and already Zana&#8217;s taken her place as Katherine&#8217;s mentor.&#160; I love it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- (<strong>SPOILER</strong>) Y&#8217;know, I&#8217;d forgotten there was such a big age gap between Fesmer and Porec, but it makes sense. Porec WAS the son of a first marriage, after all.&#160; Actually, now that I think about it, what are the age differences between the characters?&#160; We know that Katherine, Shauna, and Mike are all about 20 at this point, as they&#8217;re all Sophomores, and we learn later on that Jareth is 25.&#160; We also know that, when Jareth and Porec were friends as children, Porec was several years older&#8230;which would probably put Fesmer at about 19 or 20 too (Hmm, Shauna likes &#8216;em older, huh?).&#160; Arkahn is a complete mystery (big surprise there), but she probably falls between Jareth and Fesmer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Remember, parents do what they do out of love.&#8221;&#160; Aaaaand now I feel like crying.&#160; I&#8217;ll hold off on my commentary on (<strong>OH HECK, IT&#8217;S A SPOILER</strong>) Zana and Dita &#8216;til we reach that point, but oh man, this random, throw-away line just got 100 times more poignant.&#160; Say what you will about what Zana did, but I never doubted for a second that she loved Dita with all her heart.&#160; So it&#8217;s no wonder Zana takes such a quick shine to Katherine; an intelligent, angry, confused girl who yearns for more, the same age as her own daughter, with no real relationship to speak of with her own parents winds up on Zana&#8217;s doorstep, and, on a certain level, it&#8217;s like her own child had come back to her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Looking back, it&#8217;s easier to see why Arkahn was so threatened by her place being usurped at Zana&#8217;s.&#160; (<strong>WATCH OUT NOW, FLYING SPOILERS</strong>) She&#8217;s a child from an abusive home, and for all that she&#8217;s spying on everyone, Zana is the one person in her life who acts like a parent <em>should </em>act.&#160; Being pushed out of her safe place in Zana&#8217;s shop would not only threaten her undercover work there, it would mean that she has no one to turn to&#8230;no <em>real </em>family.&#160; Is it any surprise that she&#8217;s terrified of losing that?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I love how nonchalant everyone is about someone being KILLED BY ZOMBIES.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Alright, this is a random note that I always tell people when I try to get them to listen to Second Shift: I love love LOVE that the show takes three people, drops them in a fantasy world filled with zombies and evil Legionaires and magic&#8230;and then they work in a restaurant.&#160; I adore the fantastical mixed with the mundane&#8230;and honestly, isn&#8217;t this the most realistic option?&#160; And on that same token, by doing this we get to build up the characters and the world so much that by the time the inevitable Epicness hits, we CARE.&#160; OH how we care.&#160; And that&#8217;s awesome.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;In stories like this, there&#8217;s always some reason the characters end up in another world.&#160; Maybe if we beat the final boss or whatever&#8230;&#8221;&#160; WHY HELLO THERE, SUPER WELL-PLANTED FORESHADOWING.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I&#8217;d forgotten how Fesmer&#8217;s magic was kind of different from other Natural mages, in that he can adapt Ritual magic into Natural.&#160; (<strong>HOLY CRAP THIS IS A BIG SPOILER</strong>) This kind of makes sense, seeing as his was the only spell that interfered with Oren&#8217;s summoning of Shauna.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Is it bad that I sort of love that Mike, the big burly nerdy guy, can cook?&#160; Because I love it.&#160;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- &#8220;Kaeth, I said salad with legs!&#8221; &#8220;Meaning, &#8220;to go&#8221;, right?&#8221; &#8220;Meaning <em>LEGS</em>!&#8221;&#160; I love this exchange so very very much.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- I sometimes feel like Season 1 is more like a prologue to Season 2 than anything else.&#160; It&#8217;s all about setting up who these people are, what they want, and how they interact, and Season 2 is about growing them from who they were into who they will be.&#160; I say this because it&#8217;s a little odd to listen to Jareth at the very beginning; he&#8217;s <strong>so </strong>stubborn, and it&#8217;s amazing to see how far he&#8217;s come as a person, and how much he&#8217;s let go of that inflexible, unmovable person he used to be.&#160; <strike>I&#8217;m sorry I just have a lot of feelings about Jareth and his development and his awesomeness I APOLOGIZE</strike></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Hmm.&#160; Looking back, it&#8217;s way easier to understand why Fesmer&#8217;s father had those illegal spellbombs, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- (<strong>UGH I CAN&#8217;T COME UP WITH ANYTHING ELSE CLEVER SPOILER</strong>) WOW, Jareth had Arkahn pegged right at the beginning, and he never realized it.&#160; Damn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">- Can I just say that I love the ending to this episode?&#160; It&#8217;s pretty perfect.</p>&#13;
