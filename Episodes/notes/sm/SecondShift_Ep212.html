<p>Spoilers. Don’t read this if you haven’t heard it through. Not kidding. Turn around and hit play now. I will not call Spoilers again.</p>

<p>It’s um… it’s funny, this is the biggest episode yet. Longest, most revealing perhaps, with the greatest potential to take in different directions, and turn what we thought we knew on it’s head.</p>

<p>And yet, with the episode now over, I, of all people, who never use one word where I could use ten… can’t really think of what to say.</p>

<p>It’s all on them now. No more guides.</p>

<p>Deeta is now the new Katherine. Katherine’s got to take her first steps as the new Zana.</p>

<p>Maybe the only way the kids grow up, is if there’s nobody else to tell them how.</p>

<p>Much of what Zana told us, changes everything, but at the same time, changes nothing. So many questionms get a story told and spelled out, and yet we can't really bring ourselves to feel for that.</p>

<p>Like all of those who have been alive long enough to get the trick of it, Zana has things she cannot undo. For all the talk about her legacy, there are terrible things in it too. I think that it is a magnificent epitaph that her last great stab of action settled accounts, and undid all the evil that she lived her life in fear of. This one wiped the slate clean, and she knew the price to pay.</p>

<p>Zana was ready. There were many that are not.</p>

<p>And of all things, Porec had little to do with it, nor did the Legion. Zana brought this on herself in a twenty year circle. Her students brought the chickens home to roost.</p>

<p>It’s all on them now. We thought that innocence was lost when Mike fell. Then we thought the stakes were raised by losing Shauna, but this is the confirmed point of no return.</p>

<p>What will they tell Shae-Na?</p>

<p>And how does Porec keep doing that whole ‘not dying’ thing?</p>
